This AI recognize Leopards and Cheetahs.
# Big Cat Identifier

 Tells you whether a big cat is a Leopard or a Cheetah using AI.



## The Algorithm

AI that detects whether a cat is a Leopard or a Cheetah. It uses the Googlenet network to identify Cheetahs and Leopards.
The code uses if statements to print information about whether its a cheetah or a leopard.  This can help people because these animamls are simliar in appearence and mistaken for each other often. My code can help make the difference and give people useful information about each animal.

## Running this project
#1: Download jetson inference librabry onto the jetson nano with its required packages.
#2: Refer to: (https://github.com/dusty-nv/jetson-inference/tree/master)

#3: Add the my_recognition directory to the jetson inference directory.

#4: In your terminal run the file by typing:
```
    python my_recognition.py [file name here]
```

Then it will tell you whether it is a Leopard or Cheetah.
